# Movie Review Predictor
**This is a Movie Review Predictor Natural language processing based Web App which basically predicts sentiments of Movie reviews Wether the review is Negative or Positive. I have used Multinomial Naive bayes for classification that whether given review is negative or positive with max accuracy of around 91.38%.** 



NLTK Library is used to clean the dataset and tokenize it for converting it to Numerical data. This will helps to give 
accurate predictions.



This model is built in Flask Framework and deployed using Heroku.
